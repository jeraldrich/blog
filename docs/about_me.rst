Generations ago, a thinker was sitting on an old mossy log, chin resting on palm, staring intently at the empty green grass a few feet ahead. Ideas drawn from a shallow pool of knowledge, filled with spoken word and dusty scrolls, steam into bellowing thought clouds building up with mental electricity. Rapid bolts of lightening arc randomly between ideas and flash possibilities. Mental gears analyze possibilities into logical structures. Visually rearranging logical structures until… 

A goat’s panicked baah brings focus back to reality. A sudden wind rustling dried leaves wisps hazy conclusions away. The thinker let’s out a sigh, and stands up hoping only a five minutes were lost in thought rather than thirty so a scolding for daydreaming again can be avoided.


Today, alone in a quiet dark room crouched over a glowing screen, an all knowing, artificially intelligent oracle instantly answers any question. The kindling of curiosity fuels the intensity of focused imagination as rhythmic clicks and clacks spark calculated keystrokes forming the thinker’s visually constructed mental images, into bold monotype words and symbols.

With bloodshot eyes and a deep exhale, the last thoughtful detail is saved, and shoulders relax. The final logical blueprint etched forever as simple 0’s and 1’s on human civilization’s digital tape archive - invented not to long ago by a daydreaming thinker named Turing, who, when laying out in a a wheat field surrounded by stormy thought clouds dripping with possibilities, was struck by a thunderous bolt which changed the world forever.

Turing logically constructed a simple mathematical machine which could decide true or false when fed a digital tape etched with simple 0’s and 1’s. He then imagined that same digital tape stretched to infinity. The efficiency of the machine’s ability to process those 0’s and 1’s will increase exponentially, but the simple mathematics of 0’s and 1’s remain the same. 

All known knowledge could be could be etched into humanity’s digital archive, copied, and freely accessed. With a simple press of a cheap plastic button, blue electric currents could course through a vast silicon sea of microscopic electronic channels, flowing through sparking transistors projecting a logically expressed blueprint saved as simple 0’s and 1’s, into a virtually constructed pixel pop up - perfectly resembling the thinker’s imagined visual image, formed by billowing flashing thought clouds while sitting on a microfiber log.

Modern day alchemy.


My goal in life is to create something people will think is pretty neat. Whether developing software, creating music, just writing short stories, I just like to sit on my microfiber log, think, and make stuff. 

I’m also pretty into Music Theory. I’ll compose orchestral space music about every few months or so. It’s a pretty fun hobby, but getting the ‘next step’ of really improving my sound involves buying virtual instruments that are really expensive. 

If I ever invent a bot that correctly predicts all future sporting bets, I’ll first jump into a swimming pool full of real gold casted dogecoin. Once I recover from the concussion, then compose some film type music.

If you Ambient Electronic, you may like some of my tracks: https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I’m probably out jogging (Dwight: if you want to WIN like a champ, you got to FUEL like a champ *chugs two syrupy powergels……AUUAUUUGH*), or watching documentaries. I love a good documentary. Save the gorillas.

Anyways, hopefully this gives you an idea of what I’m like, and we can become buds.
