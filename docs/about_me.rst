I’ve been developing software professionally for 12+ years. I'm lucky in that I found what I loved to do early in life, and enjoy what I do - both creatively as a hobby, and balancing perfectionism with deadlines by delivering practical, well-engineered solutions that solve real world business problems. 

I'm very self motivated, driven, and focused. I'm very comfortable at any are of the stack (including mobile), but absolutely love backend development. 

Software wise, I love the challenge of realtime analytics / predictions, or building scalable, reliable services that other's can depend on. I'm pretty awesome at Django (using since 0.95), and usually find I can replace most internal CRUD apps with some well defined models and forms. MVC is beautiful when done right and you deeply understand the inheritance structure of the framework you are using.

Server wise, I love puppet, AWS architecture, and automating deployments. I know vast amounts about SQL / NOSQL databases, data warehouse techniques, and Apache Spark (and friends).

I love the feeling of automating tedious tasks that optimize my teams daily workflow. If I could puppet all my household appliances, I would.

Knowing databases - intimately - I believe is very important, because so much of your software design depends on it. I use Postgres / Mysql for transactional ACID compliance, and if I need to scale simple datasets on a massive scale, I would use Cassandra. 

Well designed queries are about really knowing the relational math that happens on indexed joins, and avoiding on disk file sorts. Knowing the specific parameter on the server to tune can make a world of difference that impacts all queries. If you are a backend developer, know your databases by truly understanding them, not from blog posts! :) 


My goal in life is to create something people will think is pretty neat. 

Whether developing software, creating music, or just writing short stories, I like to sit on my microfiber log, think, and make stuff. 

I’m also pretty into Music Theory. I’ll compose orchestral space music about every few months or so. It’s a pretty fun hobby, but getting the ‘next step’ of really improving my sound involves buying virtual instruments that are really expensive (10k+). I’m not - that - into space music.

If you like Ambient Electronic, check out some of my tracks: https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I’m probably out jogging (Dwight: if you want to WIN like a champ, you got to FUEL like a champ *chugs two syrupy powergels……AUUAUUUGH*), or watching documentaries. I love a good documentary. Save the gorillas.

Anyways, hopefully this gives you an idea of what I’m like, and we can become buds.
