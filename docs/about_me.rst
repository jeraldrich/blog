About Me
======


Hello! Hopefully by now you know, I'm Jeremy Aldrich. For some reason, after cyber stalking myself, I've come to the conclusion that those dubbed the name 'Jeremy Aldrich' are destined to work in the tech industry or mathematics. Parents, if you want your kid to be a nerd, name him Jeremy Aldrich. Though he may rebel to the jock side momentarily, he (or if you are mean, she) will never be able to deny destiny.

I've been developing professionally for 10+ years. 

I'm passionate about backend development, servers and databases because I love the idea of being the wizard in the wizard of oz that makes it all work even though it's difficult to describe exactly what I do to others.

Though I tend to avoid the phrase 'Fullstack Developer', I'm very comfortable across the whole breadth of technogologies that is enterprise web development. I'm not the biggest fan of flavor of the month front-end frameworks, but I do hope one day Emberjs.com takes over.

My favorite kind of stories are those from http://highscalability.com

One of my favorites is how What's App served billions of users from just a few highly tuned FreeBSD servers and Erlang. While pre-mature software optimization is indeed the "root of all evil" (Donald Knuth), a well designed, optimized architecture will pay huge financial and emotional dividends. Having a solid foundation will improve all structures built upon it.
 
My greatest strengths are Python, Go, SQL (MySQL, Postgres), NoSQL (Mongo, Cassandra) databases, data warehousing techniques, test driven development and being the guy who knows a lot about a lot of things. Nothing makes me more excited than solving a tough problem.

At this point in my career, I'm fascinated at optimizing a team of developers to be more efficient, rather than just myself.

While many of the agile processes are sound in principle, I think when it comes right down to it, processes are to often used as a band aid over the real problem - which is communication.

I love working with other developers, and appreciate good hour long rambling conversations about the intricacies and details of things, but honing the ability to condense those ideas into bulletpoints to "the executives" is something I've recognized as just as important a skill as knowing how to implement those bulletpoints. 

After all, the suits are typically the decision makers, so if you have a thousand brilliant thoughts spout out at once and the central idea of what you are saying is lost to who you are speaking to, then you have said nothing in the grand scheme of things. This is easier said than done for the naturally detail oriented person.

For my hobbies, I make electronic orchestral compositions at https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

I bought two books "Music Theory for Computer Muscicians" and "Harmony for Computer Muscicians". If you are the creative developer type, I think after reading a few chapters of Music Theory for Computer Musicians, it will dawn on you that creating music follows the exact same process as creating a new program. It's a logical, but also wierdly difficult to describe 'creativly abstract' type of process which satisifies that deep urge to make stuff.

Being able to create a peice of music follows the same process, but the end result is that instead of creating something practical, you've made something which stilumates the ear into a hypnotic pattern that can even sometimes make people feel emotional. Though I jealously lack the ability to sing and woo with my voice, I would love to construct a beauitul story told through audio. I'm not the biggest fan of lyrics because for me, music is visual, and when I listen to a peice, I imagine my own story in a kind of meditative way.

The human ear drum is the ultimate pattern detecting instrument and harshly demanding perfectionist judge. One sub-second out of frequency tone can ruin and dispell a 5 minute composed hypnosis so for the detail oriented mind that likes to create, I promise you will get deep satisfication by taking up the hard and windy road of music composition - so long as you force yourself to learn the 'boring' fundementals behind the math that makes up music.

Other than that, I'm probably jogging a bunch, or obsessing to embarrassing, 'korean drama' level amounts about MMA / UFC.

Anyways, if you would like to chat sometime, send me an email at jeremy@jeremyaldrich.net

I love talking about crazy ideas, practical business projects, and teaching others, so don't be shy.
