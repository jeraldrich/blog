About Me
======


Hello! Hopefully by now you know, I'm Jeremy Aldrich. For some reason, after cyber stalking myself, I've come to the conclusion that those dubbed the name 'Jeremy Aldrich' are destined to work in the tech industry or mathematics. Parents, if you want your kid to be a nerd, name him Jeremy Aldrich. Though he may rebel to the jock side momentarily, he (or if you are mean, she) will never be able to deny destiny.

I've been developing professionally for 10+ years. 

I'm passionate about backend development, servers and databases because I love the idea of being the wizard in the wizard of oz that makes it all work even though it's difficult to describe exactly what I do to others.

Though I tend to avoid the phrase 'Fullstack Developer', I'm very comfortable across the whole breadth of technogologies that is enterprise web development. I'm not the biggest fan of flavor of the month front-end frameworks, but I do hope one day Emberjs.com takes over.

My favorite kind of stories are those from http://highscalability.com

One of my favorites is how What's App served billions of users from just a few highly tuned FreeBSD servers and Erlang. While pre-mature software optimization is indeed the "root of all evil" (Donald Knuth), a well designed, optimized architecture will pay huge financial and emotional dividends. Having a solid foundation will improve all structures built upon it.
 
My greatest strengths are Python, Go, SQL (MySQL, Postgres), NoSQL (Mongo, Cassandra) databases, data warehousing techniques, test driven development and being the guy who knows a lot about a lot of things. Nothing makes me more excited than solving a tough problem.

At this point in my career, I'm fascinated at optimizing a team of developers to be more efficient, rather than just myself.

While many of the agile processes are sound in principle, I think when it comes right down to it, processes are to often used as a band aid over the real problem - which is communication.

I love working with other developers, and appreciate good hour long rambling conversations about the intricacies and details of things, but honing the ability to condense those ideas into bulletpoints to "the executives" is something I've recognized as just as important a skill as knowing how to implement those bulletpoints. 

For my hobbies, I make electronic orchestral compositions at https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I'm probably jogging a bunch, or obsessing to embarrassing 'korean drama' level amounts about MMA / UFC.

Anyways, if you would like to chat sometime, send me an email at jeremy@jeremyaldrich.net

I love talking about crazy ideas, practical business projects, and teaching others, so don't be shy.
