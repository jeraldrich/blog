Generations ago, a thinker was sitting on an old oak log, chin resting on palm, staring intently at the grassy ground a few feet away.

Imaginary steam rises from a shallow pool of knowledge, filled only with spoken word and dusty scrolls, into wispy thoughtful clouds drifting above.

Charged with restless mental electricity, rapid bolts of lightening arc between thoughts and flash creative new possibilities.

Mental gears grind fuzzy details into clear logical structures, connected and rearranged, until a visual image is perfectly constructed.

A goat’s panicked baah brings reality back to focus. A sudden wind rustles dried leaves and wisks hazy conclusions away. The thinker let’s out a sigh, stands up, and gently pats the goat on the head. Thoughts about how to make a softer wool jacket start drifting up… 


Somewhere tonight, a modern thinker is alone in a dark room, haunched over a glowing screen.

An artificially intelligent oracle eagerly awaits any queried question. Searching through a vast library of knowledge that puts all of the great libraries - combined - to shame, the answer is retrieved and given in microseconds.

The kindling of knowledge fuels the furnace of imagination.

Rhythmic clicks and clacks spark calculated keystrokes that forge the thinker’s visual picture and it's logical structures, into a blueprint of monotyped characters and mathematical symbols.

With bloodshot eyes and a deep exhale, the last detail is scribed. The blueprint ready for mass production, is pressed by the computer, into a long series of simple 0’s and 1’s instructions, for other machines to simply read and replay.

This magical medium where all the world’s 0’s and 1’s are stored, was invented by a brilliant thinker named Alan Turing, sometime around WW2.

He was laying out in a wheat field daydreaming thoughtful clouds dripping with possibilities, when a thunderous bolt broke through, and an image flashed which changed the world forever.

Turing constructed a simple machine which could be programmed to compute anything. A digital tape etched with 0’s and 1’s would be fed to it, and as long as the program could fit on the tape, the machine would calculate the results.

He then imagined that same digital tape stretched to infinity.

He accurately predicted that the efficiency of the machine’s ability to process those 0’s and 1’s will increase exponentially, but the simple mathematics of storing and retrieving 0’s and 1’s will remain the same.

All knowledge, problems, and thoughts, could be logically scribed and forever stored and on a constantly expanding medium that copies and distributes information faster than it could ever be destroyed.

With a simple press of a cheap plastic button, blue electric currents shoot through a vast silicon sea of microscopic electronic channels flowing through millions of sparking transistors - busy projecting recorded 0’s and 1’s onto a pixel canvas painted by logically designed blueprints, the virtually constructed image visually imagined in the thinker's mind.

Modern day Alchemy.

Ok, enough about software. A little about me.

My goal in life is to create something people will think is pretty neat. 

Whether developing software, creating music, or just writing short stories, I like to sit on my microfiber log, think, and make stuff. 

I’m also pretty into Music Theory. I’ll compose orchestral space music about every few months or so. It’s a pretty fun hobby, but getting the ‘next step’ of really improving my sound involves buying virtual instruments that are really expensive. I’m not - that - into space music.

If you like Ambient Electronic, check out some of my tracks: https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I’m probably out jogging (Dwight: if you want to WIN like a champ, you got to FUEL like a champ *chugs two syrupy powergels……AUUAUUUGH*), or watching documentaries. I love a good documentary. Save the gorillas.

Anyways, hopefully this gives you an idea of what I’m like, and we can become buds.
