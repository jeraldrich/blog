Generations ago, a thinker was sitting on an old mossy log, chin resting on palm, staring intently at the grassy ground few feet ahead. Ideas evaporate from a shallow pool of knowledge filled with spoken word and dusty scrolls.

Focused steam bellowing into thought clouds charged with mental energy. Rapid bolts of lightening arc randomly between ideas and flash possibilities. Mental gears refine fuzzy details into logical structures. Visually constructing and rearranging each piece until the best fit is found, and conclusion pictured. 

A goat’s panicked baah brings reality back to focus. A sudden wind rustles dried leaves and wisps hazy conclusions away. The thinker let’s out a sigh, stands up, and pats the goat on the head. Thoughts about how to make wool softer start drifting up... 


Today, alone in a quiet dark room crouched over a glowing screen, an all knowing, artificially intelligent oracle instantly answers any question.

The kindling of curiosity fuels the heat of imagination as rhythmic clicks and clacks spark calculated keystrokes, forming the thinker’s mental pictures and the logical steps that compose them, into bold monotype words and symbols.

With bloodshot eyes and a deep exhale, the last thoughtful detail is saved, and shoulders relax. The final logical blueprint etched in 0's and 1's, recorded on human civilization's digital tape archive reloving forever around the world. 

Invented not to long ago by a daydreaming thinker named Turing, who, when laying out in a a wheat field surrounded by stormy thought clouds dripping with possibilities, was struck by a thunderous bolt which changed the world forever.

Turing logically constructed a simple mathematical machine which could decide true or false when fed a digital tape etched with simple 0’s and 1’s. He then imagined that same digital tape stretched to infinity. He predicticed that the efficiency of the machine’s ability to process those 0’s and 1’s will increase exponentially, but the simple mathematics of storing and retrieving 0’s and 1’s remain the same. 

All known knowledge, problems, and ideas could be logically scribed and forever stored and on a medium that copies and distributes information faster than a phone call and is freely avaliable to most people in the world.

With a simple press of a cheap plastic button, blue electric currents could course through a vast silicon sea of microscopic electronic channels, flowing through sparking transistors projecting a logically expressed blueprint, saved as simple 0’s and 1’s, into a virtually constructed pixel pop up - perfectly resembling the thinker’soriginal pictured image that was formed by someone billowing flashing thought clouds while sitting hunched over like the thinking statue.

Modern day alchemy.


My goal in life is to create something people will think is pretty neat. Whether developing software, creating music, just writing short stories, I just like to sit on my microfiber log, think, and make stuff. 

I’m also pretty into Music Theory. I’ll compose orchestral space music about every few months or so. It’s a pretty fun hobby, but getting the ‘next step’ of really improving my sound involves buying virtual instruments that are really expensive. 

If I ever invent a bot that correctly predicts all future sporting bets, I’ll first jump into a swimming pool full of real gold casted dogecoin. Once I recover from the concussion, then compose some film type music.

If you Ambient Electronic, you may like some of my tracks: https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I’m probably out jogging (Dwight: if you want to WIN like a champ, you got to FUEL like a champ *chugs two syrupy powergels……AUUAUUUGH*), or watching documentaries. I love a good documentary. Save the gorillas.

Anyways, hopefully this gives you an idea of what I’m like, and we can become buds.
