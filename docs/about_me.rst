I’ve been developing software professionally for 12+ years. I'm lucky in that I found what I loved to do early in life, and enjoy what I do - both creatively as a hobby, and balancing perfectionism with deadlines by delivering practical, well-engineered solutions that solve real world business problems. 

My goal in life is to create something people will think is pretty neat. 

Whether developing software, creating music, or just writing short stories, I like to sit on my microfiber log, think, and make stuff. 

I’m also pretty into Music Theory. I’ll compose orchestral space music about every few months or so. It’s a pretty fun hobby, but getting the ‘next step’ of really improving my sound involves buying virtual instruments that are really expensive (10k+). I’m not - that - into space music.

If you like Ambient Electronic, check out some of my tracks: https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I’m probably out jogging (Dwight: if you want to WIN like a champ, you got to FUEL like a champ *chugs two syrupy powergels……AUUAUUUGH*), or watching documentaries. I love a good documentary. Save the gorillas.

Anyways, hopefully this gives you an idea of what I’m like, and we can become buds.
