Generations ago, a thinker was sitting on an old oak log, chin resting on palm, staring intently at the grassy ground a few feet away.

Imaginary steam rose from a shallow pool of knowledge filled with spoken word and dusty scrolls, and into thick thoughtful clouds.

Charged with restless static electricity, rapid bolts of lightening arc between thoughts, and flash creative new possibilities.

Mental gears refine fuzzy details into logical structures to be visually arranged until the best fitting image is imagined. 

A goat’s panicked baah brings reality back to focus. A sudden wind rustles dried leaves and wisps hazy conclusions away. The thinker let’s out a sigh, stands up, and pats the goat on the head. Thoughts about how to make a softer wool start steaming up... 


Today, alone in a quiet dark room crouched over a glowing screen, an all knowing artificially intelligent oracle instantly answers any question.

The kindling of curiosity, fuels the heat of imagination. Rhythmic clicks and clacks spark calculated keystrokes describing the thinker’s visual pictures and the logical steps that compose them, into a blueprint of monotype words and mathematical symbols.

With bloodshot eyes and a deep exhale, the last thoughtful detail is saved. The final logical blueprint is pressed for mass distribution as the computer converts logical meaning to simple 0's and 1's of machine instructions.

Invented not to long ago by a daydreaming thinker named Turing, who, when laying out in a a wheat field surrounded by thouthful stormy clouds dripping with possibilities, was struck by a thunderous bolt which changed the world forever.

Turing constructed a simple mathematical machine which could decide true or false when fed a digital tape etched with simple 0’s and 1’s. He then imagined that same digital tape stretched to infinity.

He predicticed that the efficiency of the machine’s ability to process those 0’s and 1’s will increase exponentially, but the simple mathematics of storing and retrieving 0’s and 1’s remain the same. 

All known knowledge, problems, and thoughts, could be logically scribed and forever stored and on a constantly expanding medium that copies and distributes information faster than it could ever be destroyed.

With a simple press of a cheap plastic button, blue electric currents shoot through a vast silicon sea of microscopic electronic channels, and flow through sparking transistors busy projecting recorded 0's and 1's into a perfect virtual reconstruction of the thinker's visual images, being painted on a pixel canvas.

Modern day alchemy.

Ok, enough about software. A little about me.

My goal in life is to create something people will think is pretty neat. Whether developing software, creating music, or just writing short stories, I just like to sit on my microfiber log, think, and make stuff. 

I’m also pretty into Music Theory. I’ll compose orchestral space music about every few months or so. It’s a pretty fun hobby, but getting the ‘next step’ of really improving my sound involves buying virtual instruments that are really expensive. I'm not - that - into space music.

If you like Ambient Electronic, check out some of my tracks: https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I’m probably out jogging (Dwight: if you want to WIN like a champ, you got to FUEL like a champ *chugs two syrupy powergels……AUUAUUUGH*), or watching documentaries. I love a good documentary. Save the gorillas.

Anyways, hopefully this gives you an idea of what I’m like, and we can become buds.
