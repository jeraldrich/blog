I’ve been developing software professionally for 12+ years. I'm lucky in that I found what I loved to do early in life, and enjoy what I do - both creatively as a hobby, and balancing perfectionism with deadlines by delivering practical, well-engineered solutions that solve real world business problems.

I’m passionate about backend development, databases, systems and software architecture design because I love designing and implementing the underlying foundation that all other applications and developers depend on and are all improved by using.

I've worked with successful startups implementing anything at any layer of the stack, and sometimes even mobile (which I enjoyed a lot!).

From the raging successes of https://libertydistribution.com and http://rewardstyle.com, to colossal financial failures like http://api.earth911.com https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/irecycle/id312708176?mt=8

Building my first computer as a kid from scavanging 'working' parts from a dumpster behind a computer repair shop, to composing orchestral space music at https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Making a go-kart out of a garden tiller motor and lawn mower wheels, to writing futuristic cowboy sci fi stories that will never be shown to anyone.

I just like to make stuff.
