I am a thinker. 

If I was born a few hundred years ago, imaginary thought clouds limited by the shallow pool of knowledge filled by word or dusty scroll, would drift above my head as I sat on an old mossy log thinking about ideas and all their visualized details. Rustling leaves blown by the wind would scatter the hazy possibilities, and I would have to search for lost goats…again.

Now today, in a quiet dark room crouched over a glowing screen, with vast avaliable knowledge and focused imagination, rhythmic clicks and clacks of keystrokes form thoughts into bold monotype words and symbols - until a logical blueprint describes all the thoughtful details to construct a virtual creation of my visualized thought.

Saved onto history’s forever expanding digital tape, invented not to long ago by a particularly deep thinker, who was lost in a storm of thought clouds in a field somewhere before lightning struck and he visualized an endless tape of 0’s and 1’s being able to calculate and store the world’s information.

From anywhere in the world, with a simple press of a cheap plastic button, blue electric currents flow across a vast silicon sea of microscopic metal channels, controlled by the 0’s and 1’s of sparking transistors converting raw machine instructions, to a constructed pixel pop up of my virtual creation.

Modern day alchemy.

My goal in life is to create something people will think is pretty neat. Whether developing software, creating music, just writing short stories, I just like to sit on my microfiber log, think, and make stuff. 

I’m also pretty into Music Theory. I’ll compose orchestral space music from time to time about every few months or so. It’s a pretty fun hobby. 

if I ever invent a bot that predicts all sporting bets correctly, after recovering from the concussion suffered from jumping head first into a swimming pool of minted gold dogecoin, I’d probably pursue it more seriously so I could write movie soundtracks. 

Here’s some of my stuff if you are into ambient electronic: https://soundcloud.com/milkysway/sets/adventures-in-hyperspace

Other than that, I’m probably out jogging (Dwight: if you want to WIN like a champ, you got to FUEL like a champ *chugs syrupy powergel……AUUAUUUGH*), or watching documentaries. I love a good documentary. Save the gorillas.

Anyways, hopefully this gives you an idea of what I’m like, and we can become buds.
